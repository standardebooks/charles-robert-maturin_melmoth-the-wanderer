					<p>In the year 1803, when Emmett’s insurrection broke out in Dublin⁠—(<em>the fact</em> from which this account is drawn was related to me by an eyewitness)⁠—Lord Kilwarden, in passing through Thomas Street, was dragged from his carriage, and murdered in the most horrid manner. Pike after pike was thrust through his body, till at last he was <em>nailed to a door</em>, and called out to his murderers to “put him out of his pain.” At this moment, a shoemaker, who lodged in the garret of an opposite house, was drawn to the window by the horrible cries he heard. He stood at the window, gasping with horror, his wife attempting vainly to drag him away. He saw the last blow struck⁠—he heard the last groan uttered, as the sufferer cried, “put me out of pain,” while sixty pikes were thrusting at him. The man stood at his window as if nailed to it; and when dragged from it, became⁠—an <em>idiot for life</em>. <a href="chapter-12.xhtml#noteref-32" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

Half the castle was battered down by Oliver Cromwell’s forces, and rebuilt in the reign of Charles the Second. The remains of the “castle” are a tower of about forty feet square, and five stories high, with a single spacious apartment on each floor, and a narrow staircase communicating with each, and reaching to the bartizan. A beautiful ash-plant, which I have often admired, is now displaying its foliage between the stones of the bartizan⁠—and how it got or grew there, heaven only knows.
